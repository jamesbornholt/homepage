I'm a Principal Applied Scientist at [Amazon Web Services][aws],
where I work on the [Amazon S3][s3] object storage service.
I lead development on S3's open-source projects,
including [Mountpoint for Amazon S3][mountpoint].
I also work on backend services like [ShardStore][shardstore],
and the [Shuttle][shuttle] concurrency testing framework.

Before AWS, I was a professor of computer science at the [University of Texas at Austin][utcs].
My research spans formal methods, programming languages, and systems.
I work to make systems software faster and safer to build
by applying automated verification and synthesis techniques to systems at scale.
My work has received best paper awards from SOSP, OSDI, ASPLOS, and EuroSys.

I got my PhD from the [University of Washington][uw],
where I was advised by [Emina Torlak][emina], [Dan Grossman][djg], and [Luis Ceze][luisceze].
