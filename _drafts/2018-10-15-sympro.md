Automated reasoning tools---verifiers that check program correctness,
synthesizers that generate correct programs, etc.---provide incredibly
powerful ways to construct safe and reliable software.
We've shown how to use verification to [build crash-safe file systems][yggy]
and synthesis to [generate accurate machine models][memsynth],
among other applications.
But the most powerful automated reasoning tool is one that *you* build
for the specific problem you're trying to solve.
While I've shown before how to [build your own synthesis tool][synth],
building a tool that's fast enough for real problems is still black magic.
If we want to give people the ability to build their own automated reasoning tools,
we need to make them understandable and debuggable.

Our new [OOPSLA'18][oopsla] paper,
[*Finding Code That Explodes Under Symbolic Evaluation*][paper],
is our first effort at making automated reasoning tools understandable.
We've developed a new *symbolic profiling* technique
that can help debug the performance of automated reasoning tools.
We've used our symbolic profiler to find bugs in several
real-world automated reasoning tools
and improved their performance by orders of magnitude (up to 300&times;!).
The symbolic profiler is already [integrated into Rosette][ros],
so it's available for use right now.
It's also just really satisfying to watch:

## Symbolic evaluation

What makes automated reasoning tools difficult to build?
I think the key problem is that these tools have an unusual execution model
in which they evaluate *all* paths through a program---a verification
tool is searching for a path that makes the program fail,
while a synthesis tool is searching for a program that succeeds on every path.

This all-paths execution style gives automated reasoning tools
unintuitive performance characteristics.
As an example,
consider this simple [Rosette][] program,
which takes as input a list of numbers `lst` and a number `k`
and returns the first `k` even numbers in `lst`:[^even]

{% highlight racket %}
(define (first-k-even lst k)
  (define xs (filter even? lst))
  (take xs k))
{% endhighlight %}

When the inputs are known,
the way this program executes is simple enough:
first, it executes the `filter` procedure
by querying whether each element of `lst` is even,
and then it `take`s a prefix of the result.

Now suppose we want to *verify* `first-k-even`,
proving that it works for *any* input list `lst` and size `k`.
To do so, we'll need to execute the function
on *unknown* (arbitrary) inputs---for example,
`lst` may contain unknown numbers,
and the prefix size `k` may itself be unknown.
When the inputs are unknown,
we have to resort to *symbolic evaluation*
to understand the procedure's possible outputs.

Symbolic evaluation executes *all* possible paths through a program.
In the case of `first-k-even`,
the different paths start when we execute the `filter` procedure.
For example,
suppose that `lst` is a list of two unknown integers `x0` and `x1`.
We don't know whether `x0` and `x1` are even,
so to execute `filter` we have to fork into four different paths:

![symbolic execution of filter]({{ "/img/post/sympro/filter.png" | absolute_url }}){: width="50%"}

Here, the four paths result in four different return values for `filter`,
depending on the assumptions we make about whether `x0` and `x1` are even.
Only once we've evaluated all four of these paths can we run the `take`
part of our procedure.
But we have to run `take` on *each* of the states generated by `filter`---in
this example, on all four paths.
Worse still,
because `k` is also unknown,
we have to do more forking when evaluating `(take xs k)`.
For example, starting from the rightmost path of filter,
we get three new paths depending on the value of `k`:

![symbolic execution of take]({{ "/img/post/sympro/take.png" | absolute_url }}){: width="50%"}

The net result is that when executing `first-k-even`
with a list of two unknown numbers `lst`
and an unknown size `k`,
we get eight distinct paths through the program.
This number of paths grows exponentially with the length of `lst`!

To control this exponential blowup,
most symbolic evaluators adopt smarter strategies
that require less forking.
For example,
when we executed `filter` above,
we ended up with two states `'(x0)` and `'(x1)`
that look quite similar---they are both lists of length one,
and differ only in the value of the first element of the list.
Rosette and other symbolic evaluators will *merge* these two paths
together to reduce exponential blowup:

![symbolic execution of filter with merging]({{ "/img/post/sympro/filter-merge.png" | absolute_url }}){: width="50%"}

Here the middle path introduces a new auxiliary variable `c0`,
whose value can be either `x0` or `x1` depending
on which of the two merged paths is chosen.
While merging paths reduces exponential blowup,
it also has a downside:
the resulting states are more complex and difficult to reason about.

## Diagnosing symbolic evaluation bottlenecks

Understanding the exponential blowup behavior of symbolic evaluation
is the key to building efficient automated reasoning tools.
For example,
if `first-k-even` were the critical bottleneck in our program,
how should we make it more efficient?
Standard performance engineering techniques like profiling
will lead us astray here,
because they do not account for all-paths execution.
In `first-k-even`,
a regular profiler tells us that `take` is the slowest part
of the procedure.
But `take` is only slow because it has to run four times,
on the four paths generated by `filter`.
The correct fix to `first-k-even` is to
control the exponential blowup of `filter`.

The best automated reasoning tools
carefully control such behavior by
regulating the evolution of the graphs we saw above,
which we call *symbolic evaluation graphs*.
Good tools choose when to merge and when to fork
based on domain knowledge about the problems
they will be applied to.
In the `first-k-even` example,
it might make sense to fork when `lst` is expected to be small
(and so gain the benefit of simpler states),
but not when it is larger.

Symbolic profiling addresses this challenge
by analyzing the symbolic evaluation graph explicitly.
It summarizes symbolic evaluation using new analyses and metrics
that can highlight the key regions of the program
that would benefit from careful control.
The result is profiling output
that understands the all-paths execution model.
In the example above,
this understanding allows symbolic profiling
to correctly identify the true bottleneck `filter`,
ranking it higher than `take`:

![symbolic execution of filter with merging]({{ "/img/post/sympro/even.png" | absolute_url }}){: width="100%" style="max-width: 100%"}

Here, the "call stack" shows the calls the program makes
(similar to a [flamegraph][]),
and the table below has one row per procedure in the program.
The profiler gathers a variety of metrics
and summarizes them as a single score,
which ranks procedure according to how likely they are to be bottlenecks.
Of course, there's much more detail about how this analysis works
in our [OOPSLA paper][paper].

## Case studies and results

We've performed a number of case studies
to demonstrate that symbolic profiling
is effective and identifies real bugs.
One study was on [Neutrons][],
a verification tool
being used to verify the software of a [radiotherapy device at the UW Medical Center][cnts].
Using the symbolic profiler,
we identified and repaired a bottleneck,
making the verification tool 290&times; faster---it's now practically instantaneous,
improving the development cycle.
Another study was on the [Cosette][] tool
for verifying SQL queries.
A recent change to Cosette introduced non-termination
issues in several benchmarks.
The symbolic profiler identified the bottleneck and,
after a simple three-line repair,
problems that did not complete within one hour now finish in seconds.
In both cases (and in others),
the project maintainers accepted our repairs.

In addition to performing case studies ourselves,
we conducted a small user study
with Rosette programmers.
We gave them previously unseen codebases with (known to us)
performance issues,
and asked them to find those issues.
Though the study was small,
we saw that users with access to symbolic profiling
were able to identify performance issues
that users with only regular profiling tools could not.
Even better, our users said that symbolic profiling
helped them to understand how symbolic evaluation works,
and gave them insight into the structure of the unseen codebases.
Since releasing the symbolic profiler as part of Rosette,
we've had several more stories from users
who have resolved real-world performance issues.

Symbolic profiling also works for more than just Rosette.
We developed a prototype for the [Jalangi][] JavaScript analysis framework,
finding performance issues in several benchmarks.
More recently,
[Galois][] has implemented our symbolic profiling technique
in their [Crucible][] symbolic evaluation framework,
coupling our [front-end analysis and UI code][sympro-ui]
with new back-end infrastructure.

## Wrapping up

Custom-built verifiers and synthesizers
are a promising approach to building correct and reliable software.
Specializing these tools to a particular problem domain
makes them "closer" to the programmer---they return
results that are more understandable and relevant---and
has the nice side effect of making them far more scalable.
But to make it practical for a programmer to specialize such tools,
their behavior needs to be understandable and visible.
Symbolic profiling is an effort in that direction,
making symbolic evaluation visible and analyzable for programmers
for the first time.
We found that symbolic profiling helps users
understand their automated tools and find performance issues
that, when fixed, lead to orders of magnitude-sized speedups.


[^even]: This program obviously isn't the most efficient way to do this, nor does it handle the case where there are fewer than `k` even elements, but it suffices for illustration.
