title: "When the Bug is in your Language: A Systems Debugging Story"
excerpt: The story of stumbling into a subtle bug in the [Racket](https://racket-lang.org) programming language, and how to debug such a low-level issue in an unfamiliar codebase.
---

While updating my [MemSynth][memsynth] research project to the latest release of
the [Racket][rkt] programming language, some of my test cases started
deadlocking. After some debugging, the issue turned out not to be in my code,
but rather a bug introduced in Racket itself after a recent refactoring.

[The resulting issue][github-issue] isn't particularly dramatic; it only occurs
in very specific circumstances, my accepted patch was a single line, and a
Racket maintainer would likely have tracked it down much more quickly than I
did. But my search for the root cause ended up touching on quite a few systems
debugging tools and techniques which, as [others][luu] have [noted][vijay], can
be really hard to teach. So I thought I'd write up a play-by-play of the search
for this bug to show a few of these techniques in use (including some that
didn't work out).

## "The build has been terminated"

Most of my research projects use continuous integration ([Travis][], usually)
to run test cases on every commit. The tests aren't fancy, and won't win any
awards for coverage or modularity, but they force me to commit code that works.
In this case, I had been running Racket v6.10 for a few days on my own machines
without issue, but my CI scripts were still using v6.9. Thinking not much of it,
I bumped those scripts to v6.10.

The first sign of trouble was this email from Travis:

![two threads running in parallel]({{ "/img/post/rktio-bug/travis.png" | relative_url }})

I know that the MemSynth test suite usually takes about 3 minutes, so the 12
minute duration jumped out at me. The build log confirmed something went awry,
ending with:

    No output has been received in the last 10 minutes, this potentially
    indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.

    The build has been terminated

To me, a stalled build like this suggested either an infinite loop or some kind
of deadlock. I figured it was unlikely a minor language update would suddenly
create an infinite loop. In addition, the test that stalled stresses a
multithreaded code path in MemSynth. So my initial hypothesis was a deadlock,
likely in my own multithreaded code, that the version update exposed.

I tried to reproduce the issue by running the stalled test locally on my Mac,
but it worked fine multiple times. I also tried the test on one of my lab's
Linux machines---not suspecting an OS-specific issue, but rather just to check I
was running the right version of everything. Here the issue occured immediately!
It only seemed to happen about a third of the time (which _feels_ consistent with
a deadlock or race condition), but that was enough to start debugging.

## A deeper issue

MemSynth's core makes queries to the [Z3 SMT solver][z3] via the [Rosette][]
language, so there are several layers involved that could be the cause of the
issue. To speed up its progress, MemSynth distributes its work across multiple
threads (using a [parallel program synthesis technique][synapse] we built),
which each invoke Z3 separately. At this point I suspected I had made a mistake
in this multithreading code, which distributes "jobs" across a fixed-size set of
threads and waits until they all complete. I had already built some simple
logging infrastructure for this code to report its performance in our
[paper][memsynth-paper], and the logs confirmed that when the deadlock occured,
the code was waiting for one thread to finish its assigned job.

I started inserting `println` statements throughout the worker thread code to
nail down where it was getting stuck.[^threadlogging] They suggested a stall
waiting for Rosette to return a result for a query---the last line of my own
code that executed was a call to Rosette's [`solve`][solve] procedure, which
invokes Z3. So the next step was to trace through Rosette's implementation ...

stuck in z3

sat/unsat difference trying to get a smaller reproducer (honestly could have stopped here)

does z3 every return the right output? enter strace

unfruitful effort: tried to slow z3 down

better idea: used gdb to break into racket when it was deadlocked (should have
done this earlier). stuck in rktio.

look at racket release notes: io refactor!

strace again hmm

git bisect failed because many intermediate commits didn't work, but identified
the rktio patch sequence

more stracing.. notice we're waiting for an epoll. try running 6.9, the epoll set we sleep on is larger. how do things get added to that epoll set?

file descriptors!

lessons: hypothesis. own code first.


[^threadlogging]: The logging code wasn't really set up to deal with multiple threads, so I needed a way to identify which thread printed each log message. A quick Racket hack was to include the hash of the current thread object in each log message: `(equal-hash-code (current-thread))`.
