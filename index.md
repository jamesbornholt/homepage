I'm an Assistant Professor of Computer Science
at the [University of Texas at Austin][utcs],
and a Senior Applied Scientist
in the [Automated Reasoning Group][arg]
at Amazon Web Services.

I work on programming languages and formal methods.
My research helps programmers build more reliable software using
*automated programming tools*: verification tools
that check program correctness,
and synthesis tools that generate correct programs from specifications.
I work to make automated tools easier to [build][synapse] and to [scale][sympro],
and deploy them on important programming problems in [systems][ferrite] and [architecture][memsynth].

I received my PhD in 2019 from the [University of Washington][uw],
where I was advised by [Emina Torlak][emina], [Dan Grossman][djg], and [Luis Ceze][luisceze],
and a member of the [UNSAT][] and [PLSE] groups.
I also have a masters from UW and a bachelors from the [Australian National University][anu].
