Iâ€™m a fifth (and final) year PhD candidate in the [PLSE][] and [UNSAT][] groups at the [University of Washington][uw],
advised by [Emina Torlak][emina], [Dan Grossman][djg], and [Luis Ceze][luisceze].
I work on programming languages and formal methods,
with an emphasis on building scalable automated reasoning tools
for program verification and synthesis.

I have a masters from UW and a bachelors from the [Australian National University][anu].
I've also spent time at [Microsoft Research][msr] and [Amazon Web Services][aws].
I'm grateful to be supported by a [Facebook PhD Fellowship][fb].

> I'm on the faculty job market this year!
