**In Autumn 2020 I will join the [University of Texas at Austin][utcs]
as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science.**

I'm a fifth (and final) year PhD candidate in the [PLSE][] and [UNSAT][] groups at the [University of Washington][uw],
advised by [Emina Torlak][emina], [Dan Grossman][djg], and [Luis Ceze][luisceze].

I work on programming languages and formal methods.
My research helps programmers build more reliable software using
*automated reasoning tools*: verification tools
that check program correctness,
and synthesis tools that generate correct programs from specifications.
I work to make automated reasoning tools easier to [build][synapse] and to [scale][sympro],
and deploy them on important programming problems in [systems][ferrite] and [architecture][memsynth].

I have a masters from UW and a bachelors from the [Australian National University][anu].
I've also spent time at [Microsoft Research][msr] and [Amazon Web Services][aws].
I'm grateful to be supported by a [Facebook PhD Fellowship][fb].
