I'm an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science][utcs]
at the [University of Texas at Austin][ut].

I work on programming languages and formal methods.
My research helps programmers build more reliable software using
*automated programming tools*: verification tools
that check program correctness,
and synthesis tools that generate correct programs from specifications.
I work to make automated tools easier to [build][synapse] and to [scale][sympro],
and deploy them on important programming problems in [systems][ferrite] and [architecture][memsynth].

I received my PhD in 2019 from the [University of Washington][uw],
where I was advised by [Emina Torlak][emina], [Dan Grossman][djg], and [Luis Ceze][luisceze].
I also have a bachelors from the [Australian National University][anu].
Before starting at UT, I was a Senior Applied Scientist
at Amazon Web Services,
where I worked on [automated reasoning][arg] for [Amazon S3][s3].
