- built lots of verification and synthesis tools
- kind of a black magic thing when they don't work
- want people to have powerful tools but they need to be understandable or people will ignore

- sympro is a profiler for verification and synthesis tools
- core of the problem is symbolic evaluation and all-paths execution
- identifies hotspots that ordinary tools cannot because it understands these
- great case studies and results
- open source!

## Profiling symbolic evaluation

- sym exec explores all paths
- sometimes paths merge
- controlling this data structure is key to performance
- but we need to make it explicit for debugging
- also states can be complex, so we have a "heap"

## Common anti-patterns and repairs

- algorithms
- data structures
- concretization

- show `list-set` (cite to smten) as cute example

## Case studies

- neutrons
- ferrite was the motivating example
- and more

- user study
- galois

## The future
